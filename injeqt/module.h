 * Injector is normally constructed from set of modules, each one contains

 *
 * Modules are move-only types and cannot by copied.
 *
 * To add a module to system one must inherit from it and configure it in constructor and
 * then pass instance of it to created injector class.
 *
 * Set of types in given module does not have to fully satify each one dependencies - it
 * is only required for a group of modules passed into injector.
 *
 * Module configuration is done by calling any of add_* method. Currently implemnted are:
 * add_ready_object, add_type, add_factory.

	 * @throw qobject_type when passed type @p T represents QObject
	 * @throw invalid_qobject when passed @p object is nullptr or does not have valid QMetaObject
	 * @throw interface_not_implemented when passed @p object does not implements type @p T
	 *
	 * It has to be fully constructed and must not expect any injection to take place on it
	 * (even if it has INJEQT_SET methods). However this object could be injected into other
	 * ones as it if is of type T.
	 *
	 * Real type of object must be same as T or descend from it. In other cases an exception
	 * will be thrown.
	 *
	 * Module class does not take ownership of this object. Either subclass of module must do
	 * it in any way or calee must ensure that object will be destroyed after module is destroyed.
	 *
	 * Example usage:
	 *
	 *     class injectable : public QObject

	 *         }
	 *     };
	 *
	 * In second example responsibility for ready_object's lifetime lies on ready_module2 object
	 * creator.
	 *
	 * When injector object is created with any of these modules this code will lead to return
	 * the same object thas was passed to add_ready_object method:
	 *
	 *     auto o = injector.get<injectable>();

	 * When an object of that type (or one of inherited types) is requested from injector or

	 * returning pointer to T* and not accepting any arguments if called to create T object.
	 * Type F must be registered in any of injector modules.
	 *
	 * Type F must contain exactly one method marked with Q_INVOKABLE macro that returns object
	 * of type T* and does not have any arguments. In other case an exception will be thrown.
	 * Qt meta-object system unfortunately does not allow us to require returned type to be
	 * std::unique_ptr<T> which would make object ownership clear in code.
	 *
	 * After object of type T is created it will be injected will all required dependencies
	 * and it will remain in cache until owning injector object exists. Onle one instance of
	 * T will exist at one time inside injector (this may change when in future scope abstraction
	 * will be added to library, but it won't affect default behavior). Injector takes ownership
	 * of created T object.
	 *
	 * Example usage:
	 *
	 *     class injectable : public QObject
	 *     {
	 *         Q_OBJECT
	 *     public:
	 *         injectable(int arg) { (void)arg; }
	 *     };
	 *
	 *     class injectable_factory : public QObject

	 *
	 * Note that injectable constructor does not have to be maked with Q_INVOKABLE. Also note that

	 * that would have to be included into final injector).
	 *
