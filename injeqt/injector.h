 * @brief Injector is created from set of modules that contains injectable types.
 *
 * Injector is constructed from set of modules that contains groups of related types.
 * Then it can be used to get instances of configured types that have their dependencies
 * resolved and set - there is no need to manually wire services and factories.
 *
 * If two or more modules have the same type configured an exception is thrown during construction.
 * Otherwise, from all types in modules a set of available types is computed. Each type directly
 * added to modules is added to it. Then all unique super types are added to this set. This means
 * that two types with common ancestor can be used in injection. Note that Qt meta object system
 * only supports single inheritance.
 *
 * Injector takes ownership of modules passed to it. Also all objects created inside injector
 * (using default constructor - configured with module::add_type<T>(), or factory - configured
 * with module::add_factory<T, F>()) are under its ownership. Lifetime of objects added as ready
 * objects (configured with module::add_ready_object<T>(QObject *) is not managed by injector.
 * For clarity ready objects can be stored in module instances as unique pointers. Injector will own
 * then as it own modules.
